  <h2>Why Nairobi?</h2>
  <h3>Nairobi - where modernity meets tradition.</h3>
  <p>The name "Nairobi" is derived from a Maasai phrase "Enkare Nairobi," which translates to "cool water." This name was given to the area by the Maasai community who were the original inhabitants of the region.<br>During the late 1800s, Nairobi was just a swampy area with no permanent human settlements. However, in 1896, the British colonial government chose the site to be the headquarters of the Uganda Railway construction project, which aimed to connect Uganda to the coast of Kenya.</p>
  <p>In 1905, Nairobi was officially declared a town, and it continued to grow and develop over the years. After Kenya gained independence in 1963, Nairobi became the capital city of the newly formed republic. The city has since continued to grow and develop into a bustling metropolis, playing a key role in Africa's economy and a hub of cultural diversity.<br>Nairobi's rich history is a testament to the resilience and tenacity of its people, who have transformed a swampy land into a vibrant and dynamic city.</p>
